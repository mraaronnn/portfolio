                    <h3>Fish Farm Feeder</h3>
                    <p>As the demand for fish farming in the Philippines expands, traditional Nile Tilapia farming face challenges such as feeding inefficiencies due to rough estimation, flooding, evaporation, as well as poor water quality management. The UNESCO SDGs were also prioritized to support Goal 14: Life Below Water.</p>
